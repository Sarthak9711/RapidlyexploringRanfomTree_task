Download the "RRT.zip" file and unzip it.
After that change the your current directory to "RRT" using "cd ~/RRT" command in the terminal.

Make sure you have python downloaded and installed on your system.
(Preferably python3 or newer version.)

Start and Goal are already hard coded in the script file on line 172 and 173 respectively.

Run the command "python3 RRT_script.py"
